## History of Static Site Generators (SSGs)
 
Static site generators became popular after the release of Jekyll in late 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner (co-founder of GitHub).

>“I was tired of complicated blogging engines like WordPress and Mephisto. I wanted to write great posts, not style a zillion template pages, moderate comments all day long, and constantly lag behind the latest software release.”

 * Slow build times

Explain architecture.
- Flat files
- Build process (How do you manage these)
- Most people built these on their own laptops

GitHub and GitHub Pages
* Webhooks
* API

This was unsuccessful: prose.io

:frowning: 

Prose tried to make it such the ordinary people could manage content.

Prose was ahead of its time.

They did cool stuff with Drupal.

## The Dark Days

Stagnation in innovation.

* Personal portfolio projects
* Documentation
* Project/GitHub page sites

## The Adjacent Possible

Gatsby - the first of it's kind
Netlify CMS

## The Renaissance

Everybody can be have happy! You don't have to choose developer ergonomics over content editor experience.

Node and JavaScript took the place of Ruby.
Web browser emerged as a viable application platform.

* React
